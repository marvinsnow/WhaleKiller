<h5>WHAT IS A FRONTRUNNING BOT ?</h5>

<p>Front-running concept</p>

<i>
  Front-running is taking advantage of KNOWING that a future transaction will
  affect the price and placing an order right before that transaction to make a
  profit for yourself
</i>
<br />
<i>
  For example, in traditional finance, if a trader or fund knew that Tesla‚Äôs
  TLSA stock was about to be bought by someone in a volume of up to $10 million,
  they could place a buy order just in advance and when the order to buy 10
  million dollars is done causing the price to expand, they will immediately
  place a sell order and enjoy the profit.

Front-running Bot in Crypto</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Front-running bots see a potentially front-run trade (the slippage is large
    enough, the price impact is high enough to be profitable).
  </li>
  <li>
    Insert a buy order with a reasonable size (because the buy order will also
    affect the price) before the user‚Äôs order
  </li>
  <li>
    Discharge immediately after the user command is executed. The profit of bots
    lies in the user-generated slippage, which facilitates buying at low prices
    and selling at high prices.
  </li>
</ul>
